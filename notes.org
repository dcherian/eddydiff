#+TITLE: Eddy diffusivity from microstructure

* Todo [0/2]
- [ ] neutral density calculation?
- [ ] equations for mixed layer

* Conventions
1. Climatology name: ~clim.attrs.dataset~
2. Transect name : ~transect.transect_name~
3. Potential density referenced to 0: ~sigma0~
4. in-situ density: ~rho~
* Notes
** Things I've learned
1. *Smoothing* cubic splines are a little funky near the edge. Need a "natural" boundary condition that forces curvature to be 0 at edge. NG2016 seems to suffer from this too.
2. ECCO RhoAnoma is /in-situ/ density anomaly! Argo has potential density.
3. Why ECCO instead of Argo? - deeper than 2000db!
